# KC7 Cybersecurity Training

Welcome to my KC7 Cybersecurity Repository! My username on the platform is **ethiocipher**, and this repository documents my hands-on experience solving real-world cybersecurity challenges using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** and **Azure Data Explorer**.

The KC7 Cybersecurity Simulation is a gamified platform where I actively participate as a **Threat Intelligence Analyst**, identifying and mitigating security threats in dynamic scenarios. This repository includes case descriptions, skills I honed, and the KQL queries I developed to analyze event logs, detect anomalies, and respond to incidents.

## What the KC7 Game Does
Takes you on a journey exploring data and discovering what actions the adversaries have taken.

Ask questions that mirror the investigative path Threat Intel Analysts would use to find the hackers.

## üöÄ Skills & Tools Highlighted:

- **Threat Intelligence**: Investigated security incidents.
- **Event Log Analysis**: Queried and analyzed logs to detect anomalies and patterns indicative of threats.
- **Network Security**: Explored vulnerabilities and implemented detection mechanisms.
- **Azure Data Explorer**: Leveraged the power of KQL to interact with datasets and perform advanced analysis.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Completed Cases:

### 1. **Frognado in Valdoria**
- **Description**: I successfully investigated a hacktivist intrusion on FramtidX‚Äôs system. Through my use of Kusto Query Language (KQL), I discovered how the intruders managed to deface the company‚Äôs website and internal documents. I followed the activities of the threat actor, from reconnaissance to exfiltration, and uncovered the use of an internal account to further their compromise.
- **Key Achievements**: Discovered threat actor reconnaissance, identified internal account misuse, and mitigated further compromise.
- **Skills Gained**: Threat actor tracking, website defacement analysis, and data exfiltration detection.

### 2. **Rap Beef**
- **Description**: I investigated a web defacement incident linked to rival musicians. Using key cybersecurity skills, I identified suspicious communications and activities, analyzed internal messages, and uncovered patterns of unauthorized exchanges.
- **Key Achievements**: Discovered the attacker‚Äôs IP address, mapped out their attack sequence, and mitigated data risks.
- **Skills Gained**: Web application security, forensic investigation, and vulnerability management.

### 3. **Solvi Systems**
- **Description**: I investigated a ransomware attack targeting a major technology company. Using KQL, I uncovered the threat actor‚Äôs reconnaissance efforts, system compromises, and malware activities. I traced the ransomware propagation and identified the initial compromise vector.
- **Key Achievements**: Tracked phishing campaigns, analyzed malware activity, and strengthened security postures.
- **Skills Gained**: Malware analysis, phishing detection, lateral movement detection, and containment strategies.

### 4. **Titan Shield**
- **Description**: I successfully investigated two highly sophisticated cyberattacks against TitanShield‚Äôs sensitive projects. I demonstrated advanced investigative skills in identifying social engineering tactics, malicious file execution, and data exfiltration strategies. Utilizing Microsoft Defender XDR, I detected advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- **Key Achievements**: Unraveled phishing campaigns, detected romance schemes, and safeguarded intellectual property.
- **Skills Gained**: Advanced threat detection, endpoint security, social engineering reconnaissance, and advanced defense strategies.


### 6. **AzureCrest**
- **Description**: I investigated a ransomware attack, where cost-cutting measures led to a single point of failure in their systems. Additionally, I addressed multi-vector attacks targeting cloud-based services, analyzing cloud event logs to uncover unauthorized access attempts.
- **Key Achievements**: Identified single points of failure, mitigated ransomware attacks, and proposed enhanced security measures.
- **Skills Gained**: Ransomware analysis, vulnerability identification, cloud security, multi-cloud monitoring, and advanced log querying.

### 6. **Valdoria Votes**
- **Description**: I investigated an email phishing attack in Valdoria that uncovered a politically motivated influence campaign. Using KQL, I analyzed employee roles, email communications, and computer process events, revealing evidence of data exfiltration and manipulation.
- **Key Achievements**: Detected election tampering attempts, safeguarded voting infrastructure, and preserved data integrity.
- **Skills Gained**: Phishing detection, data integrity analysis, and influence campaign investigation.

### 7. **A Scandal in Valdoria** üåü
- **Description**: Uncovered a data breach in Valdoria's financial systems.
- **Key Achievements**: Identified malicious insider activity through log correlation and anomaly detection.
- **Skills Gained**: Insider threat analysis, root cause analysis, and critical thinking.
