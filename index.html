    <section id="case-overview">
        <h2>Case Overview</h2>
        <p>HopsNStuff is a brewery renowned for crafting the most delectable ginger beer around. But what truly sets them apart is their secret formula, passed down from generation to generation. In this case, I was tasked with investigating a cyber intrusion involving multiple data sets and tracking the activity of advanced persistent threats (APTs).</p>

    <section id="key-observations">
        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <h3>1. Suspicious Files and Processes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dev-Requirements.zip:</strong> Several employees clicked links to this file, likely part of the initial malicious payload. PowerShell was used to bypass execution policies and install malicious software.</li>
            <li><strong>RabbitMQ.exe:</strong> A known messaging service file was being run by suspicious processes like 7zip.exe, which is a known tactic for attackers to run malicious payloads using legitimate software.</li>
            <li><strong>Mimikatz:</strong> The use of Mimikatz to dump logon credentials indicated credential harvesting, which is a key element of lateral movement in an attack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Potential Watering Hole Attack:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The creation of files like <strong>Ginger_beer_secret_recipe.pdf</strong> and <strong>Brewery_layout.pdf</strong> on multiple hosts suggests a targeted phishing campaign or watering hole attack.</li>
            <li>Outbound Connections: 50 outbound connections and suspicious domains tied to these files suggest exfiltration or malware spreading.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. External IP Addresses:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The discovery of multiple external IPs logging into infected machines from diverse geographical locations is indicative of an APT using compromised credentials to move laterally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Exfiltration:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of <strong>rclone.exe</strong>, a tool often used for data exfiltration, along with connections to domains like <strong>moneybags.biz</strong>, pointed to the theft of proprietary data, likely the secret recipe.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="investigation-steps">
        <h2>Investigation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify Affected Systems:</strong> Review the hosts involved with Dev-Requirements.zip and mimikatz activity. Cross-reference with the IP addresses used to pinpoint where tools like rclone.exe were triggered.</li>
            <li><strong>Trace Network Activity:</strong> Examine outbound traffic related to suspicious files and look for unusual data transfers to external IPs.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Backdoors:</strong> Investigate the TeamViewer sessions initiated by the attacker and file transfers linked to this activity for any remnants of deleted files.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Compromised Systems:</strong> Recommend isolation of compromised systems, resetting user credentials, and implementing stricter email filtering policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Forensics on Affected Hosts:</strong> Given the suspicion around certain files, forensically examine affected hosts to identify the source of the exfiltration.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="recommendations">
        <h2>Recommendations for HopsNStuff</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Implement stricter segmentation to limit lateral movement and restrict access to sensitive data.</li>
            <li><strong>Email and Web Filtering:</strong> Enhance email security with sandboxing or attachment scanning and ensure proper web filtering to block malicious sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Credential Management:</strong> Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and regularly rotate credentials to prevent credential harvesting.</li>
            <li><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):</strong> Implement or enhance EDR tools to monitor suspicious activity on endpoints in real-time.</li>
        </ul>
